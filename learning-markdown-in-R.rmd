## Summary 

The **International Labour Organization** (ILO) has many [data sets](http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/lang--en/index.htm) on working conditions. For example, one can look at how weekly working hours have been decreasing in many countries of the world, while monetary compensation has risen. In this report, *the reduction in weekly working hours* in European countries is analysed, and a comparison between 1996 and 2006 is made. All analysed countries have seen a decrease in weekly working hours since 1996 â€“ some more than others.
